## Forum API

The goal of this project is to create a forum with real time notifications (using WebSockets) where new themes and 
posts can be created, answered, fixed, evaluated (like or dislike) and followed, so the user can be notified of any new 
answers.

I also use:
- Swagger for documentation;
- JPA for persistence;
- JWT for authentication;
- SparkPost to send emails;
- Cloudinary to upload images into the cloud.

PS.: I'm still learning, and I appreciate any bug report or advice you can give me. My email is joanoldaniel@gmail.com.
